What's this?
============

regexxer is a nifty search/replace tool for the desktop user.  It features
recursive search through directory trees and Perl-style regular expressions
(using libpcre).

regexxer is written in C++ and uses gtkmm (the C++ wrapper for GTK+) for
the GUI.  The user interface is similar to the project-wide search/replace
dialog in the Sniff+ IDE, but regexxer aims to surpass it.

The primary audience of this tool are Linux/Unix users who are tired of
typing find/grep/sed/awk/perl command lines.
