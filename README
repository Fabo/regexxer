regexxer is a nifty search/replace tool for the desktop user.  It features
recursive search through directory trees and Perl-style regular expressions
(using libpcre).

regexxer is programmed in C++ and uses gtkmm2 (the C++ wrapper of GTK+ 2.0) for
the GUI.  The user interface is similar to the project-wide search/replace
dialog in the Sniff+ IDE, but regexxer aims to surpass it.

The primary audience of this tool are Linux/Unix users who are tired from
typing find/grep/sed/awk/perl command lines.  But since GLib is used to
abstract the platform the code should be portable to Windows or any other OS
with relatively low effort.
