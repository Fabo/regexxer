## REGEXXER_PKG_PATH_PROG(variable, package, executable)
##
## Like AC_PATH_PROG(variable, executable, [not found], <extra_path>), where
## <extra_path> is set to the contents of $PATH prepended by the package's
## binary executable directory.  This should catch even the weirdest setups.
## An error message is generated if the executable cannot be found anywhere
## in the resulting path.
